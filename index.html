                <h3>ALTAIR</h3>
                    <p class="text">Developed in 1963, BASIC had become a popular programming language in a few years, owing to the fact that it was easy to learn for beginners but had the necessary functionality that could be stretched by advanced coders. In the 1970s MITS had come out with their Altair 8800 microcomputer machine. Paul Allen and Bill Gates contacted MITS founder Ed Roberts telling him that they were developing an interpreter, and asked whether he would like to see a demonstration in a few weeks. What was of interest was that the duo had announced a non-existent product to gauge interest of the buyer. They neither had an interpreter and not even an Altair system on which to develop and test. The code was finally sold in 1975 for $3000 to MITS; and Bill and Paul were also hired to maintain and improve it. </p>
