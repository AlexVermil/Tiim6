                <h3>ALTAIR</h3>
                    <p class="text">Developed in 1963, BASIC had become a popular programming language in a few years, owing to the fact that it was easy to learn for beginners but had the necessary functionality that could be stretched by advanced coders. In the 1970s MITS had come out with their Altair 8800 microcomputer machine. Paul Allen and Bill Gates contacted MITS founder Ed Roberts telling him that they were developing an interpreter, and asked whether he would like to see a demonstration in a few weeks. What was of interest was that the duo had announced a non-existent product to gauge interest of the buyer. They neither had an interpreter and not even an Altair system on which to develop and test. The code was finally sold in 1975 for $3000 to MITS; and Bill and Paul were also hired to maintain and improve it. </p>

                <h3>WINDOWS 95</h3>
                <p class="text">Although MS DOS had established Bill Gates’s Microsoft among the most successful and leading companies in the technology revolution, they were yet to give their finest and biggest offering – Windows. It was arguably the game-changer in personal computer software. Windows 95 was released to enthusiastic customers in the August of 1995 and turned out to be the operating system (OS) that changed everything. Windows is currently installed in high majority of computers (some estimating it close to 90 percent) in the world. Windows 1.0 was originally a graphical version of MS DOS as a competition against Apple’s ‘Lisa’. Inspired by the advances in the Xerox PARC, Windows 95 gave the most commercially successful version of a GUI using the WIMP “window, icon, menu and pointing device” paradigm with revolutionary features like plug and play and multitasking.</p>
